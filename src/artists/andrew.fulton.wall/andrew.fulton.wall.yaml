  ##_Down By The Water Was A Wall,_ by Andrew Fulton
  A creation myth of sorts, a bittersweet tale of lust and destruction drawn in wonky wavy lines and two different kinds of dot.  

  _This comic contains a couple of sex parts so might not be safe for work depending on your work_
  
  > ...but it's clear that he's talented and has deeper ideas lurking under this veneer of silliness.

  Andrew draws short wordless comic stories for his website [mumblier.com](http://mumblier.com). His drawings have appeared in various local and international anthologies, although on reflection that's a fairly meaningless thing to say.  He uses a dip pen - mostly a g-nib, if you're the kind of person who asks that kind of thing.

  He also organises the Minicomic of the Month Club subscription series, which you should totally subscribe to when it becomes available next year.
