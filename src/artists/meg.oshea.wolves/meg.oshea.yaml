  ##_The Wolves of King Street_, by Meg O'Shea
  _The Wolves of King Street_ is a story of an intoxicated night out with anthropomorphic wolves. 
  
  It was made in 2014 as part of a class taught by Pat Grant, and might one day even be in colour.

  Meg is a Sydney-dwelling animation student who has been known to make comics in the past, but would now like to make even more.
